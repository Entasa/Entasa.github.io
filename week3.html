    <p> In the reading, "As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush, Bush makes numerous detailed predictions of the future of science and technology. Fast forward 71 years later, we live in the reality he imagined.
        Bush mentions in the reading:  </p>
    <blockquote>
        A record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted. Today we make the record conventionally by writing and photography, followed by printing; but we also record on film, on wax disks, and on magnetic wires.
    </blockquote>
    <p>While reading this quote, I realized how it must have been impossible to fathom something like the Cloud as a way to store our records during the time period Bush lived in. For us to now live in a digital world with unlimited data storage seems like such a large jump from even 20 years ago.</p>
