           <li>Excess testosterone – we all produce some testosterone, but too much can prevent ovulation and change your menstrual cycle </li>
            <li>resistance – your body has to produce much more insulin than normal to keep blood sugar levels stable. Excess insulin floating around also increases testosterone produce and can lead to…</li>

       <h2> Cardio </h2>
       <h3>Good for reducing insulin resistance, boosting fertility, stabilising mood</h3>
       <p> Moderate exercise like brisk walking, jogging, cycling or swimming are all great activities that can help with PCOS. This type of exercise increases your bodies sensitivity to insulin, which reduces your risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Doing 30 minutes or more a day can also help with weight management, symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as improving frequency of menstrual cycles and ovulation.  </p>
