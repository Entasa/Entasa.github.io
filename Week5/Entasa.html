            When first glancing at the display set up for Lungs, it looks like your average
            computer desk set up. I believe this adds to the arts symbolisim of technology's impact on our daily lives.
            Graham Harwood discusses in the audio guide, the dynamics in our relationship to modern day tech and whether we are 
            the ones actually enslaved by it. Before Harwoods artwork, the recorded data of each 57,000 slaves still existed but somehow having 
            it alphabetically ordered in a spreadsheet dulled the tragedy for us.

            The purpose of Harwood's poem memorial was to honor the thousands of slaves from World War II.
             The original data used in Harwood's code was collected from Nazi created databases. The Nazi's use of IBM and the poem memorial had 
             far from similar purposes but did however, have the same information. The same databases used by the Nazis helped Hardwood create this memorial which allows 
             people to experience a intimate human connection to each and every slave laborer listed.
